Imagine it is Ancient China. Amongst the billions of people living in this era, you are one of the poorest. Every day, the greatest struggle is not to get into your dream university, but how to put food onto the table for your grandparents. Wherever you go, the stink of your unwashed shirt and lack of status in the city is like a heavy anvil pressing down on you, forcing you to bow your head to corrupt officials and rich people, and your only option is to grit your teeth and endure the shame.
